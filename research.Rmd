### **Research Goals**\
\
I aim to, 1) develop a dockerized container for the identification of *Compound Heterozygous* variants, 2) survey the landscape of *Compound Heterozygous* across pediatric cancers and structural birth defect diseases, and 3) evaluate and improve haplotype phasing methods for individual patients when parent genome data is not available.
